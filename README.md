# Password-Reset-Backend

This is a sample Password-Reset API, designed and developed by me. It's Guvi-Zen class Roadmap session: Day-41 and Nodejs- Day -5: Authentication Task.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Router()
- json()
- CORS
- Validator
- bcrypt
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- dotenv
- nodemailer
- Nodemon
- Mongoose
- MongoDB Atlas
- Postman

## Features

- <b>User Authentication</b> : Secure user registration and login using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for authentication tokens.
- <b>Password Management</b> : Users can reset their passwords securely.
- <b>Email Notifications</b> : Integrated email notifications using nodemailer for account verification and password reset processes.
- <b>Robust Validation</b> : Input validation using Validator to ensure data integrity.
- <b>CORS Handling</b> : Configured CORS to allow secure cross-origin requests.


## Lessons Learned

<b>Express Server and API Endpoints</b> : 
- <b>Express Server</b> : Learned to create a robust and scalable Express server to handle API requests and responses.
- <b>API Endpoints</b> : Gained experience in designing and implementing RESTful API endpoints for various operations.

<b>Security and Authentication</b> : 
- <b>JWT</b> : Implemented JWT for secure authentication, ensuring only authorized users can access certain endpoints.
- <b>bcrypt</b> : Used bcrypt for hashing passwords, enhancing the security of user credentials.
- <b>Validator</b> : Integrated input validation to prevent malicious data from being processed by the API.

<b>Email Integrations</b> : 
- <b>nodemailer</b> : Learned to send emails for account verification and password reset processes, improving user experience and security.

<b>Environment Configuration</b> : 
- <b>dotenv</b> : Utilized dotenv for environment variable management, keeping sensitive information secure and configurable.

<b>Database Management</b> : 
- <b>Mongoose</b> : Mastered using Mongoose for MongoDB interactions, including schema design and CRUD operations.
- <b>MongoDB Atlas</b> : Leveraged MongoDB Atlas for a scalable, cloud-based database solution.

<b>API Testing and Documentation</b> : 
- <b>Postman</b> : Used Postman extensively for testing API endpoints, ensuring they work as expected and handle edge cases properly.
- <b>API Documentation</b> : Documented API endpoints to provide clear and concise instructions for future developers and users.
